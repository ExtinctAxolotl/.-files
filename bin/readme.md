# the `bin/` dir
self explanatory isn't it?

***E X E C U T A B L E S***

## `bin/`
Executables that will be manually added to $PATH by placing them somewhere (probably ~/.local/bin)

## `i3/`
i3 related executables **deprecated, abondoned, homeless whatever you wanna call it**

## `installations/`
Installs software that unfortunately is sometimes needed but hopefully never used

## `others/`
other stuff
