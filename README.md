# The Dotfiles
## Some info's
These are my personal configuration files + things i use when installing a new system.

### File Information

|               Source               |                             Info                             |
| :--------------------------------: | :----------------------------------------------------------: |
|               `src/`               |                 All the configuration files                  |
|              `misc/`               | Miscellaneous files (whenever something system related needs a backup) |
|               `bin/`               | Executable scripts that are very useful (often configurations depend on said scripts) |
|             `linux.sh`             | A script to setup these dotfiles (**WIP**, *issues are welcome*) |
| other directories (exp: `autumn/`) |        These are other bombadil profiles to mess with things\*          |

 \* take a look at [bombadil](https://github.com/oknozor/toml-bombadil) to learn more about profiles
