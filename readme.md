|              `misc/`               | Miscellaneous files (whenever something system related needs a backup) |
|               `bin/`               | Executable scripts that are very useful (often configurations depend on said scripts) |
| other directories (exp: `sway/`) |        These are other bombadil profiles to mess with things\*          |
